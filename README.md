This application was written in 2005.

**DESCRIPTION**

This application was used for managing shareholders assemblies when they voted on some issues.

It contained a list of all shareholders along with their share percentage.

Upon starting the application, the moderator would enter:
- all questions on which the shareholders would vote,
- all present shareholders with their total share count (their shares and shares of all shareholders they represent)

After the voting, the results would be displayed and printed.
